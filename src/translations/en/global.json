      "restDesc": "REST (Representational State Transfer) is a web architecture style that defines a set of principles for creating web services. REST is designed to allow clients to communicate with servers in a stateless manner, meaning that each request from the client contains all of the information necessary to complete the request, and the server does not maintain any state between requests. RESTful web services are built using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). The goal of REST is to provide a simple, lightweight, and scalable architecture for building web services that can be easily integrated with other systems. ",
      "httpDesc": "HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a widely-used protocol that enables communication between web browsers and web servers. It is the foundation of the World Wide Web and allows for the exchange of various types of data, such as HTML documents, images, videos, and other multimedia content. When a user requests a webpage through their web browser, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server, and the server responds with an HTTP response that includes the requested content. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that each request and response is independent of any previous requests and responses. However, it also supports mechanisms for maintaining state, such as cookies and session management. HTTP has undergone several versions, with HTTP/1.1 being the most widely used. HTTP/2, which is a major revision of the protocol, provides faster and more efficient communication between clients and servers, and is becoming increasingly popular.",
